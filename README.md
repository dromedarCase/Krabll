## General Information

### About

We want to create a population, that "learns" from generation to generation.
To realize this "learning" process, every creature's "brain" connects n-many inputs with m-many outputs.
Once we created 100 creatures, we mix the "brains" of those, who survived the longest time.
The whole learning process is indeed a little bit more complicated, but this is basically, how it works.

### Licensing

This is a research project for the 'Jugend-Forscht' science fair.
This project will presumably get an open license on completion of said fair.

### Compatibility

The project requires JRE >= 8 for a successful execution.
It's being tested on Windows 8 and 10, as well as on a handful of GNU/Linux distributions.

### Included Libraries and Programs

* [Java 8 SE](https://www.java.com/)
* [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html)

### Project Structure

The actual source code is located in the "core" directory.
The "desktop" folder only contains the launcher class (including the `main()` method).
