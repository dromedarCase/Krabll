## General Information

### About

We want to create a population, that "learns" from generation to generation.
To realize this "learning" process, every creature's "brain" connects multiple perceptions/inputs with several actions/outputs.
Once we created 100 creatures, we mix the "brains" of the ones, who survived the longest time.
The whole learning process is indeed a little bit more complicated, but this is basically, how it works.

### Licensing

This is a research project for the 'Jugend-Forscht' science fair.
This project will presumably get an open license on completion of said fair.

### Compatibility

The project requires JRE >= 8.
It's being tested on Windows 8 and 10, as well as on a few GNU/Linux distributions.

### Included Libraries and Programs

* [Java 8 SE](https://www.java.com/)
* [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html)

* [Box2D](http://box2d.org/)

### Project Structure

The actual source code (including assets) is located in the "core" directory.
To view our recent ideas about how the major source code should look like, please click [here](https://github.com/kreiseltyp/Krabll/issues).
The "desktop" folder only contains the launcher class (including the `main()` method).
